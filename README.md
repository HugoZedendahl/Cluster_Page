-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8, iPhoneX, OnePlus8T and Samsung Galaxy 4s.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly throughout every stage of development.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues, with special recognition to Alvin Zedendahl for QA testing.

### Known Bugs

-   the FAVICON regularly returns a 404 error code. the source that triggers this has not been discovered, this is not present when testing on google Chrome. but has ocassionally been triggered when testing on the Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari Browsers

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HugoZedendahl/Cluster_Page)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HugoZedendahl/Cluster_Page)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HugoZedendahl/Cluster_Page)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/HugoZedendahl/Cluster_Page
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/HugoZedendahl/Cluster_Page
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
